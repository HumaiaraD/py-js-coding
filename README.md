# ðŸ§  JS vs Python: A Beginnerâ€™s Programming Journey

Welcome! This is a personal project where I document my learning experience by building the same small projects in **JavaScript** and **Python**. As someone whoâ€™s still learning both languages, this journey helps me strengthen my understanding by comparing how each language solves the same problem differently.

## âœ¨ Why This Project?

While JavaScript and Python serve different purposesâ€”JS mainly for web development and Python often for scripting, automation, or data scienceâ€”they share a lot of fundamental programming concepts.

I realized that by doing the **same project in both**, I could:
- Practice core programming skills
- Learn language-specific features and quirks
- Develop better problem-solving habits
- Build muscle memory in both languages
